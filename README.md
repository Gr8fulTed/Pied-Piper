## File Sharing Made Simple
Pied Piper is tables.
Pied Piper is for sharing, simply upload your file and share with your friends or watch them in your browser with our PP Player.
Using Pipe-to-Pipe (P2P Sharing) technology your file is instantly available everywhere and not everywhere at the same time.

## Powered by Javascript
PHP is old just like ~~Hooli~~.

It's time for a new lightweight application that fulfills your file sharing needs, in your browser.

This means Pied Piper is fast, easy and flexible right from the start.

UI Inspired by Lufi


Pied Piper uses:
* [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/) For the really nice framework.
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com) For j.query stuff
* [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) Dates for real.
* [Filesize.js](http://filesizejs.com/) Look, the name's pretty explanatory.
